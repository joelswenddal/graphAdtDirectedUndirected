## General info
These programs were written as part of my first Data Structures course in university. Both DirectedGraph and UndirectedGraph classes include a range of methods that implement common functions and uses of these structures.

## Class methods

### Directed Graph:
1. add_vertex
2. add_edge
3. remove_edge
4. get_vertices
5. get_edges
6. is_valid
7. dfs
8. bfs
9. has_cycle
10. dijkstra

### Undirected Graph:
1. add_vertex
2. add_edge
3. remove_edge
4. remove_vertex
5. get_vertices
6. get_edges
7. is_valid_path
8. dfs
9. bfs
10. count_connected_components
11. has_cycle

## Technologies
Python 3
